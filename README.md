## Project Overview
This project implements and analyzes the FLINNG (Fast Locality-sensitive Indexing using Nested Group testing) algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search. The algorithm combines techniques from Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and group testing to efficiently find nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces.
